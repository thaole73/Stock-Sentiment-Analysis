# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

Stock markets tend to react very quickly to breaking news. Negative news will cause people to sell stocks and otherwise. By analyzing the sentiment/attitude toward stocks from news articles, social media, or financial reports, investors can extract insights and make data-driven decisions about whether to buy or sell a stock.
